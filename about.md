My name is Ryan! I am a Computer Engineering student at UC Santa Cruz with an emphasis in Systems Programming.
This website is a server for some of my projects (although most not publicly accesible) and hopefully a landing page for some of my more recent activities and projects.

This website was made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) It's pretty cool I think, but al so just allows me to be more lazy :).
I use a theme from [GitHub Pages Themes](https://github.com/pages-themes), licensed under CC0-1.0.
The GitHub Repository for this project can be found [here]().
