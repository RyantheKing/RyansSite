My name is Ryan! I am a Computer Engineering student at UC Santa Cruz with an emphasis in Systems Programming. \\
This website is a server for some of my projects (although most not publicly accesible) and hopefully a landing page for some of my more recent activities and projects. \\
\\
This website was made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). \\
Big thanks to hailstorm5437 for the site icon pixel art! \\
Thank you to [@rogeriopvl](https://twitter.com/rogeriopvl) and [@girlie_mac](https://twitter.com/girlie_mac) for the [HTTP Cats](https://http.cat) API and art. \\
